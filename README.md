# Autonomous Cars

This project focuses on developing a self-driving car simulation without relying on external machine learning or AI libraries. The only library used is **Pyglet** for rendering graphics and running the simulation.

## Project Overview

The **Autonomous Cars** project simulates a self-driving car using neural networks and genetic evolution algorithms. The car is capable of navigating an environment, avoiding obstacles, and improving its driving performance over time by evolving through generations.

### Features

- **No External Libraries:** Apart from Pyglet, no additional libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or OpenCV are used.
- **Neural Network:** A simple neural network is used to process sensor data from the car and make decisions.
- **Genetic Algorithm:** The cars evolve through a genetic algorithm, improving their performance with each generation.
- **Real-time Simulation:** The car's driving behavior and environment are rendered in real-time using Pyglet.
